# Halite-II
Halite is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by Two Sigma, where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board.

# Languages

## Python(Rank: 363)
Utilized Python because it is a language I am familiar with and was a easy to implement strategies. Had to switch because the amount of 
time to execute operations took too long therefore Java was a better choice. 

## Python-Machine Learning(Rank: 401)
Utilized a machine learning strategy because I wanted to learn more about the setup and keras specifically. Analyzed various parts of the
code and attempted to improve various aspects of it such as network architecture and training data set. 

## Java(Rank: 148)
Utilized Java because it is a language that is known for number-crunching therefore allowing me to do more computations in each turn when
compared to python. Implemented many of my computations from the python bot into this bot and added more that allowed my ships to maximize
their efficiency per turn.


You can find the code for each bot in their respective folders and see a more detailed description of my changes in their respective folders!
